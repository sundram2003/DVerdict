==================
According to the reports as per 10th december 2023, over 10,0000 cases were added to the Supreme Courtâ€™s pendency list in the last five months,which has increased from 69,766 cases as on July 1 to 80,040 on December 1, 2023.It had taken three years previously from March 2020 to July 2023,to add 10,000 cases to the SC pendency
 The major contributor to this problem is the shortage of the court rooms. 
In order to deal with this problem, we came up with this solution to provide a decentralised platform named DVerdict where the small cases like divorce,theft, property etc can be dealt with along with providing a decentralised video conferencing court rooms where the judge,culprit,victim,prosecutor and defence will be able to join in a more secured way so that no unauthorised user will be able to join the decentralised court rooms. 






See the section about deployment for more information.
